# 🧮 Insurance Predictions with Machine Learning & Linear Algebra  

> Applied Machine Learning and Linear Algebra to insurance use cases: customer similarity, claim prediction, regression, and data privacy via obfuscation.

✅ Español: Machine Learning y Álgebra Lineal aplicados al sector seguros: similitud de clientes, predicción de reclamos, regresión y protección de datos mediante ofuscación.  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project is part of the **Sprint 13: Linear Algebra** module at TripleTen Latam.  
The project focused on supporting **Sure Tomorrow**, an insurance company, with several predictive and data privacy tasks.

## 🛠️ Tasks Completed  
- **Task 1:** Implemented similarity search between clients to support marketing campaigns.  
- **Task 2:** Built classification models to predict whether a new client is likely to receive insurance benefits. Compared performance against a dummy (baseline) model.  
- **Task 3:** Trained a linear regression model to predict the amount of insurance benefits for new clients.  
- **Task 4:** Designed and applied a **data obfuscation algorithm** using linear algebra transformations. Demonstrated that models could still perform well while protecting client privacy.

## 🚀 Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (classification & regression models)  
- Linear Algebra (matrices, transformations for obfuscation)  

---

## 📈 Results  
- Demonstrated that ML can outperform dummy models in claim prediction.  
- Built regression models to estimate benefit amounts with good accuracy.  
- Developed and validated a **data protection algorithm** to obfuscate customer data while keeping ML performance intact.
